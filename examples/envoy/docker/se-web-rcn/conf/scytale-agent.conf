# Assumptions: Workloads run on Unix instances

# Fields that must be edited:
#   server_address: IP or DNS address of the Scytale Server
#   trust_domain: SPIFFE trust domain that the Scytale Server and Scytale Agent use
#
#   private_key_path and certificate_path under x509pop NodeAttestor plugin
#     must be edited to point to the private key and certificate used for proof-
#     of-posession.  If your setup uses and intermediate certificate, uncomment
#     and edit the intermediates_path line.
#
# trust_bundle_path will likely need to be edited to point to the path of your trust bundle

  # bundle acquired from the server:
  # use the command:  
  #   scytale-server bundle show > bundle.pem
  # 
  # to extract a short-lived bundle which can be used in the agent's trust_bundle_path configuration
  # field.  Keep in mind that since the bundles exracted that way are short-lived, it will be
  # necessary to provide a means of automatically provisioning agent instances with an up-to-date
